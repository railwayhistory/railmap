# railmap

This repository contains the map renderer behind the Railway History Map.
It takes a map described through a simple language based on a set of
paths, renders them as bitmap tiles, and provides those via a built-in
HTTP server.

The map resulting from the description in the sibling
[railwayhistory/map](https://github.com/railwayhistory/map) repository can
be viewed at [map.railwayhistory.org](https://map.railwayhistory.org/).
